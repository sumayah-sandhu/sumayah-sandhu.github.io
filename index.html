        This website was created as an extensive and engaging way to introduce myself professionally. I hope you enjoy this visual representation of myself and I am looking forward to connecting with you!
       
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        My name is Sumayah Sandhu and I am a Junior at the University of Oklahoma studying Management Information Systems and Finance.
        I am a driven and diligent student and I am looking to obtain a career within the Information Technology field upon graduation. I am currently involved
        in a plethora of organizations on campus and work part time as a services specialist for OU Information Technology. In my free time, I enjoy a good book and cup of coffee.
