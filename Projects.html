        <h2>Operation School Bells</h2>

        Last spring, alongside a team of three other students, I served on a project to create a database for
        Assistance League of Norman, a non profit organization that serves families and children through community
        events. They were implementing an initiative called Operation School Bells that provides clothing and school
        supplies to children in a retail like environment. Based on their asks, my team and I utilized Microsoft SQL Server to create
        a database to better organize and store information about
        all the items that they would be providing to the children. We also created a series SQL statements to extract
        data from the database that was specific to the Client's needs.

        <h2> The Hershey Company Pro Forma Model</h2>

        In the fall of 2020, I was enrolled in a financial modeling course. Alongside two other team members, I created a pro forma financial model in Microsoft Excel that
         projected the future financial status of the company. I analyzed Hershey's current financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, and statement of 
        cash flows) and used pertinent values such as projected cash flows, net profits, and taxes to summarize Hershey's future financial performance.
