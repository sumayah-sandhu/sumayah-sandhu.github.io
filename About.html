    <h1>About Me</h1>

    
     
        I am originally from Norman, Oklahoma and currently attend college in Norman at The University of Oklahoma. Throughout my time in college, I have developed 
        a strong interest in the field of consulting. My first exposure to consulting was through The Oklahoma Group, a non profit consulting 
        organization that provides pro bono, professional consulting services to nonprofits in the community. I have realized how rewarding consulting is, 
        given that you have the ability to significantly improve an organization. Consulting is also very dynamic and I appreciate the way that the profession
        gives you the opportunity to learn so much every day. I am specifically interested in technology consulting. My goal for the future would be for 
        me to be in a position where I can advise organizations to utilize various information technology tools to improve their functions.
